# Comfy — AI-driven ComfyUI all-modal workspace

> This repository is a **ready-to-use ComfyUI all-modal workspace**: the ComfyUI main program, MiniMax H3 video + Qwen-series image + Stable Audio/Qwen3-TTS audio generation, 43 custom node packs (GGUF/KJNodes/upscaling/speedup, etc.), 24 image/video/audio workflows, and a model catalog plan.
>
> **Core idea: all installing, configuring, running, generating, and workflow training is delegated to the AI (OpenCode).** You only need to: install Git → clone this repository → install OpenCode → let it work.

## What is this

- **ComfyUI main program** (`ComfyUI\` submodule, master branch, v0.33.1) — a local node-based AI image/video/audio generation engine
- **Custom nodes** (43, centralized in the root `custom_nodes\`, loaded via a **directory-level** symlink at `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\`; the full list is in `AGENTS.md`):
  - `ComfyUI-FallingTS` — our own general-purpose utility node pack (5 nodes: Continue/Selector/Table/Switch/PreviewVideo + frontend enhancements)
  - `ComfyUI-GGUF` / `ComfyUI-KJNodes` — GGUF quantized loading / large utility node pack
  - `ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler` / `ComfyUI-SUPIR` / `ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale` — super-resolution upscaling/restoration
  - The 6 H3-ecosystem plugins (Spectrum / SolAttn / ReservedVRAM / Qwen3-TTS / latent-upscaler / OrbitSheets scene reference boards) + the other 31
- **Workflow suite**: 24, grouped by number (1xxx Everything / 2xxx Scene camera / 3xxx-4xxx Video generation / 5xxx Decomposition / 6xxx-7xxx Audio; see [Appendix B](#appendix-b--workflow-catalog))
- **Model directory** (`models\`, symlinked to the project root) — see [Appendix C](#appendix-c--model-download-list)
- **Docs**: a local clone of the official docs at `docs\ComfyUI-Docs\`; the workspace description in `AGENTS.md`

---

## Before you start

- **System**: Windows 10/11 or Linux (this repo is written for Windows deployment by default; see "Appendix H: Migrating to Linux" for Linux/macOS deployment)
- **Hardware**: 16 GB+ RAM; an **NVIDIA GPU** gives the best experience; it runs without an NVIDIA card, but slowly
- **Network**: just needs external internet access; some regions need a proxy; for model downloads inside China use the `hf-mirror.com` mirror (see Appendix E)
- **You don't need to install anything in advance** — Python, CUDA, the virtualenv, and all the CLIs are installed by the AI for you

---

## Step 1: Install Git

Git is used to clone this repository and manage the submodules. Download the installer from **https://git-scm.com/download/win** (64-bit, click "Next" through the default options); after installing, run `git --version` in a terminal — if it prints a version number, you're good.

---

## Step 2: Clone this project

Run in Git Bash:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/falling-ts/Comfy
cd Comfy
```

When done you have a complete workspace containing `ComfyUI\`, the various `ComfyUI-*\` plugins, `workflows\`, `models\`. **All subsequent work happens inside this `Comfy` directory.**

> Note: after cloning, `models\` is empty (models are too large to ship with the repo) — download them per [Appendix C](#appendix-c--model-download-list); `media\` is empty too; it's home for input/output files.

---

## Step 3: Install OpenCode (Desktop)

OpenCode is the AI workhorse between you and this workspace — it installs software, configures the environment, and runs workflows.

1. Open **https://opencode.ai/zh/download** in a browser and download the **Desktop** edition
2. Install and launch OpenCode
3. In the left panel, **Add project**, and select the `Comfy` directory you just cloned
4. After that, just talk to the AI inside this project

---

## Step 4: Run OpenCode as administrator and set up the symlinks

> ⚠️ **Important**: this workspace relies on **relative-path symbolic links** pointing the relevant directories inside `ComfyUI\` at the project root (`models\`, `media\`, `workflows\`, the plugin directories). **Creating symlinks requires administrator privileges, so run OpenCode as administrator.**

1. Find OpenCode in the Start menu, right-click → **Run as administrator**
2. Open this project (add the `Comfy` directory) and send it the following:

> Please check and repair this project's symlinks per the "symlink plan" below (all **relative-path** symlinks, 7 total; the full list is in `AGENTS.md` "Symlink map"):
>
> 1. **Directory-level plugin link**: make sure `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` is a symlink pointing to `..\custom_nodes` (the root plugin aggregation directory; all 43 plugins are loaded through this single link; **not** the old one-link-per-plugin scheme);
> 2. **Base links**: `ComfyUI\input` → `..\media`, `ComfyUI\output` → `..\media`, `ComfyUI\models` → `..\models`, `ComfyUI\user\default\workflows` → `..\..\..\workflows`;
> 3. **Sub-links**: `custom_nodes\H3ReferenceSuite` → `..\h3\minimax-h3-guide\custom_nodes\H3ReferenceSuite`; `.claude` → `.agents`;
> 4. Once everything is done, confirm these paths show as "symbolic links" and verify subdirectories like `ComfyUI\models\diffusion_models` can be entered normally.
>
> Note: only replace real directories; keep real directories like `ComfyUI\temp\`; all links use relative paths so they survive moving the whole project folder.

3. With the symlinks ready, continue to [Step 5](#step-5-have-opencode-install-its-own-cli-optional).

---

## Step 5: Have OpenCode install its own CLI (optional)

If you like the command line, say "install the opencode CLI for me — search the web for the specific download/install"; once installed, `cd Comfy && opencode` and go.

---

## Step 6: Have OpenCode install other AI tools (optional)

When needed, say "install the following AI tools for me: codex, claude code, cc-switch — search the web for the specific download/install"; you get a swappable AI CLI suite.

---

## Step 7: Have OpenCode set up the Python environment

Send this to OpenCode (to create a `.venv` virtualenv at the project root):

> Create a Python 3.13 virtualenv `.venv` in the project root (if the system has no Python 3.13, install the official Python 3.13 first). Search the web for the specific download/install.
>
> Note: the environment must live at the project root `.venv` (not the system Python); all subsequent dependencies go into this environment — don't use system Python.

Once done, verify (it will run in the terminal):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # on Unix-like systems: source .venv/bin/activate
python --version
```

---

## Step 8: Have OpenCode install ComfyUI dependencies and start it

Send this to OpenCode (it will, in order: install the CUDA build of PyTorch → install the main dependencies → install each plugin's dependencies → start):

> Enter the `ComfyUI` directory and, in order:
>
> 1. **First install the CUDA build of PyTorch**: run
>    `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130`
>    (first detect which CUDA version my NVIDIA GPU/driver supports and pick the matching `cuXXX`; if there's no NVIDIA card, install the CPU build)
> 2. Then install the rest: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> 3. Then go into every plugin directory under `custom_nodes\` (43 of them, see the directory layout in `AGENTS.md`), check each one's required dependencies (its `requirements.txt` or README) and install them all.
> 4. Finally, back in `ComfyUI`, start it: `python main.py --enable-manager`
>
> Once it starts successfully, tell me the frontend address.

After startup, open **http://127.0.0.1:8188** in a browser — that's the ComfyUI frontend.

---

## Step 9: From here on, everything is the AI's job

Once the environment is ready, you can have the AI do everything:

- Download models (per [Appendix C](#appendix-c--model-download-list); just say "download model xx into models\yyy\")
- Run / modify / create workflows (in `workflows\`)
- Install new custom nodes, debug, tune parameters, generate images, train
- Video/audio/image generation (MiniMax H3, Stable Audio, Qwen series, etc.)

In one sentence: **you say "what you want"; the AI handles "how to do it".**

---

## FAQ

- **Proxy / slow downloads**: direct connection by default; on failure use a local proxy (e.g. Clash's `127.0.0.1:7890`); for HuggingFace models inside China use the `hf-mirror.com` mirror — just replace the `huggingface.co` prefix in the link with `hf-mirror.com` (see Appendix E)
- **Symlinks**: `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` (directory-level, aggregates 43 plugins), `models`/`input`/`output`/`workflows`, etc. — 7 relative-path symlinks in total. Creating links needs administrator privileges; the recommended way is to **run OpenCode as administrator** and have it repair them (see [Step 4](#step-4-run-opencode-as-administrator-and-set-up-the-symlinks)); or manually enable "Developer Mode" (Settings → Privacy & security → For developers → Developer mode on)
- **Not enough VRAM**: the Klein 9B distilled version is VRAM-hungry (a 24G card is tight at 1024 tiles; drop to 768 if OOM); MiniMax H3 needs a lot of VRAM — for low-VRAM cards use the quantized version or the cloud (see the Appendix C notes)
- **After placing models, remember to restart ComfyUI** so the loaders pick up the new models

### Symlinks (7 total, all relative paths)

`ComfyUI\input`/`output` → `media`, `ComfyUI\models` → `models`, `ComfyUI\user\default\workflows` → `workflows`, `ComfyUI\custom_nodes` → `custom_nodes` (**directory-level, aggregates 43 plugins**), `custom_nodes\H3ReferenceSuite` → `h3\minimax-h3-guide\...`, `.claude` → `.agents`. All are **relative-path** symlinks — they survive moving the whole project; creating/repairing them needs administrator privileges; the full list is in `AGENTS.md` "Symlink map"; `ComfyUI\temp\` is a real directory (not a link) and can be cleaned up anytime.

## Appendix B · Workflow catalog

`workflows\` contains **24** main workflows, named "number-purpose" and grouped (the frontend saves right here):

### Image / "Everything" class (1xxx, 3, based on Qwen-Image-2512 / Qwen-Edit 2511 / FLUX.2-Klein)

| Workflow | Purpose |
|--------|------|
| `1000-万物建模` | Main pipeline (everything modeling) |
| `1001-灰度遮罩` | Grayscale mask tool |
| `1010-万物变化` | Everything change/transform |

### Scene camera class (2xxx, 4)

| Workflow | Purpose |
|--------|------|
| `2000-场景首帧` | Scene first-frame generation |
| `2010-场景拉镜` | Camera pull-out / push-in transform |
| `2020-场景推镜` | Camera push-in transform |
| `2030-场景旋镜` | Camera orbit rotation |

### Video generation class (3xxx-4xxx, 9, MiniMax H3)

| Workflow | Purpose | H3 mode |
|--------|------|---------|
| `3000-文生场景` | text → scene video (visual only, no audio track) | T2VA (fl2va) |
| `3010-图生场景` | first-frame image → scene video | I2V (fl2va) |
| `3020-参考场景` | multi-image + multi-video reference → video | R2V (ref2va) |
| `3030-OrbitSheets场景` | anchor image → H3 multi-angle camera → visual frame picking into a "scene reference board" grid image | I2V (fl2va) + OrbitSheets plugin |
| `3040-Skythread场景` | character/prop/empty-scene three references (single responsibility) → scene video | R2V (ref2va) |
| `4000-文生视频` | text → video (generic version isomorphic to 3000) | T2VA (fl2va) |
| `4010-图生视频` | first-frame image → video | I2V (fl2va) |
| `4020-首尾视频` | first+last frame → video | fl2va |
| `4030-参考视频` | reference image/video → video | R2V (ref2va) |

> 3000/3010/3020 correspond one-to-one with 4000/4010/4020/4030 (the former is the scene-pipeline version, the latter the generic version); the audio track has been removed from all — video + audio are merged in the post pipeline (5xxx-7xxx). 3030/3040 supplement scene-reference production: 3030 produces "scene reference board" grid images (for use as reference input to 3020/4030), 3040 is the Skythread-style three-reference simplified method.

### Decomposition class (5xxx, 2)

| Workflow | Purpose |
|--------|------|
| `5000-视频拆帧` | video → per-frame images |
| `5010-视频拆音` | video → separated audio |

### Audio generation class (6xxx-7xxx, 6)

| Workflow | Purpose | Core model |
|--------|------|---------|
| `6000-背景音乐` | Pure instrumental BGM | Stable Audio 3 (built-in Sage acceleration) |
| `6010-环境音效` | Ambient/atmosphere sound | Stable Audio 3 |
| `6020-效果音效` | One-shot / SFX | Stable Audio 3 |
| `6030-文生人声` | text voice description → speech | Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign |
| `6040-参考人声` | 3-second reference audio clone → speech | Qwen3-TTS CustomVoice |
| `7000-截取声音` | Audio crop/extract tool | — |

> The old image 8 / video 4 / audio 5 workflows that used to be archived under `templates\` before 2026-08-09 have been deleted; the current numbering scheme is canonical.

## Appendix C · Model download list

> Scheme principles: fully open-source, local inference, zero API cost. The list below corresponds **one-to-one** with the local `models\` directory (verified 2026-08-19); the status column reflects what is actually ready locally. A brand-new environment (Linux 5090 server) must re-fetch from the download URLs, or migrate `models` wholesale via rsync per [Appendix H.4](#h4--file-transfer-and-symlinks). **Recommended download order**: audio small items first (the full Qwen3-TTS set, SenseVoice, Stable Audio 3) → video large items (the full MiniMax H3 set — download both fl2va and ref2va) → image large items (Qwen-Image 2512/Edit 2511, FLUX.2 Klein). Note that `flux-2-klein-9b-fp8` is a **gated repo** (you must log in to HF and accept the BFL terms); after placing models, **restart ComfyUI** so they are recognized.

### MiniMax H3 speedup essentials

- **Standard kit (built into the workflows)**: Sage Attention (+20–30%, KJNodes `Patch Sage Attention KJ`) + EasyCache (built-in ComfyUI node, parameters 0.30/0.20/0.90, at the cost of long-video coherence) + Turbo LoRA (~5x, see above)
- **VRAM**: runs on 8G/12G/16G (dynamic offloading, clip encoder on CPU); local max is 768p, 2K needs the official API; when VRAM is tight, add a `🎈VRAM/RAM-Cleanup` node or `--vram-headroom`

## Appendix E · Network and mirrors

- **Direct external connection by default**; on direct-connection failure (timeout/403/TLS cut), switch to a local proxy, e.g. the Clash Verge mixed port `127.0.0.1:7890` (both HTTP and SOCKS5 work)
- **HuggingFace China mirror**: just replace the `huggingface.co` prefix in the download link with `hf-mirror.com`, e.g.
  `https://hf-mirror.com/Comfy-Org/MiniMax-H3/resolve/main/vae/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors`
- Some sites (e.g. OpenAI-family domains) get blocked by Cloudflare on direct connection; you need a proxy node that allows the corresponding domain

## Appendix H · Migrating to a Linux + RTX 5090D server (2026-08-06)

> Goal: Windows (8 GB VRAM / 16 GB RAM) → Linux server (RTX 5090D, 32 GB GDDR7).
> Baseline environment: torch 2.13.0+cu130, sageattention 2.2.0+cu130 (post6), triton-windows 3.7.1.post27 (Windows-only; on Linux use `triton`).

### H.1 Hardware / drivers (prerequisites)

- RTX 5090D = Blackwell architecture, **sm_120**, 32 GB GDDR7; the CUDA cores are the same as the 5090 (21760), but the AI throughput is about 71% of the 5090 (2375 vs 3352 TOPS)
- **The Linux driver must be ≥ 570** (CUDA 12.8+); just install the latest 580/6xx series; only continue once `nvidia-smi` recognizes sm_120
- torch must support sm_120: **2.7+cu128 or later**; the 2.13.0+cu130 used here satisfies it. Never use an old torch (2.5.x/cu124 will report `no kernel image available for sm_120`)

### H.2 Rebuilding the environment (Linux cannot directly reuse the Windows environment)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch==2.13.0+cu130 torchvision==0.28.0+cu130 torchaudio==2.11.0+cu130 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
# The remaining dependencies come from a `pip freeze` of the Windows environment as requirements; the only replacement:
#   triton-windows==3.7.1.post27 → triton (matching torch 2.13)
```

- **sageattention**: 2.2 supports Blackwell; before compiling from source, set `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="12.0"` (**only 12.0, do not add 9.0**, or the compile fails); on Blackwell it's about 6% faster than torch attention (community measurement, lower than Ada)

### H.3 Startup parameters (differences from Windows, key points)

| Windows parameter | Linux handling |
|---|---|
| `--disable-pinned-memory` | **Remove** (a Windows 0.30.x regression workaround; on Linux, pinned memory can use up to 95% of RAM — it's a speedup item) |
| `--fast-disk` | **Remove** (a compromise for 8G VRAM / 16G RAM; with 32G VRAM, Qwen-2512 fp8 ~19.5G fits entirely, no disk paging needed) |
| `--enable-manager` | Keep |
| Suggested addition | The default dynamic VRAM is fine; when models can stay resident, try `--highvram` (main model 19.5G + text encoder 7.9G ≈ 27.4G) |

Change the startup script to `start-comfyui.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd "$(dirname "$0")/ComfyUI"
source ../.venv/bin/activate
python main.py --enable-manager
```

### H.4 File transfer and symlinks

- The super-project: `git clone --recurse-submodules <remote>` (**50 submodules**)
- **models ~189 GB are rsynced separately** (`rsync -avP`); the server needs ≥300 GB NVMe reserved
- Rebuild the symlinks (`ln -s` relative paths, 7 total, see the Appendix A list):
  - `ComfyUI/input → ../media`, `ComfyUI/output → ../media`, `ComfyUI/models → ../models`, `ComfyUI/user/default/workflows → ../../../workflows`
  - `ComfyUI/custom_nodes → ../custom_nodes` (**directory-level, aggregates 43 plugins**), `custom_nodes/H3ReferenceSuite → ../h3/minimax-h3-guide/custom_nodes/H3ReferenceSuite`, `.claude → .agents`
- `ComfyUI-FallingTS/.env` (API keys) does not go into git; place it separately on the server and `chmod 600`
- Chinese file names/paths are fine under Linux UTF-8

### H.5 Server recommendations

- RAM **≥64 GB** (the H3 video pipeline eats RAM; 32G is the floor); pair it with 32–64 GB swap as a safety net
- Remote access: SSH port-forward to `127.0.0.1:8188`, or `--listen 0.0.0.0` + firewall allowlist
- The 5090D at full load is 575 W; confirm the power supply and cooling headroom
